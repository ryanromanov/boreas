# Boreas

A small programming language with Fortran's look and stricter rules: every
variable is declared, arrays are bounds-checked, and conditions must be logical.
Currently a tree-walking interpreter written in Python.

## Install and run

    pip install .
    boreas examples/hello.bor

## Test

    python3 -m unittest discover -s tests

## Example

    function square(real :: x) -> real
      return x * x
    end function

    program demo
      integer :: ys(3) = [1, 2, 3]
      print "squares:", ys * ys, square(2.5)
    end program

## Constants

    const real :: pi = 3.14159
    const integer :: primes(3) = [2, 3, 5]

A `const` needs a value and can never be assigned, used as a `do` variable, or
passed as an `out`/`inout` argument. Fortran's `parameter` converts to `const`.

## Arrays

Arrays have any number of dimensions, 1-based and stored column-major like
Fortran. A scalar subscript drops that dimension; `:` keeps it.

    real :: m(2, 3) = reshape([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], [2, 3])
    print m(1, :), m(:, 2), m(1:2, 2:3)    ! row, column, block
    m(2, :) = 0.0                          ! sections can be assigned
    print matmul(m, transpose(m))

Operators work elementwise and need matching shapes (scalars broadcast).
Built in: `size`, `shape`, `reshape`, `matmul`, `transpose`, `dot_product`,
`sum`, `maxval`, `minval`, `any`, `all`; `sqrt`, `abs`, `sin`, `cos`, `exp`,
`log`, `real`, `int`, `mod` apply to every element.

## Subroutines and parameter modes

Results come back through `out` / `inout` parameters:

    subroutine swap(inout integer :: a, inout integer :: b)
      integer :: t
      t = a
      update a = b
      update b = t
    end subroutine

    call swap(x, y)

Every write to an `out` / `inout` parameter is marked with `update`, so a reader
can see which assignments change something outside the subroutine. Using
`update` on anything else, or leaving it off for such a parameter, is an error.
Parameters default to `in` and cannot be assigned. Functions only take
`in` parameters. An output variable may not be passed twice in one call, and an
`out` parameter must be assigned before the subroutine returns.

## Modules

A module groups constants and procedures. Everything in it is private unless
marked `public`, and a program (or another module, or a single procedure) imports
exactly the names it uses:

    module geometry
      public const real :: pi = 3.14159

      public function area(real :: r) -> real
        return pi * r ** 2
      end function
    end module

    program demo
      use geometry: area, pi
      print area(2.0)
    end program

Nothing is visible without a `use`. Importing a private or missing name is an
error, an imported constant is read-only, and modules cannot import each other in
a cycle. Modules hold only constants and procedures for now (no mutable module
variables). See `examples/modules.bor`.

## Converting Fortran

    boreas convert legacy.f90 -o legacy.bor

Reads free-form Fortran (not fixed-form `.f`) and writes Boreas source plus a
report on stderr. Translations that change meaning are flagged, never silent:

- `! TODO(convert): ...` comments quote any line that could not be translated
  (modules, `select case`, `allocate`, derived types, `goto`, `read`, ...).
- `parameter` constants become `const`.
- Missing declarations are filled in using Fortran's implicit typing rules.
- Dummy arguments without `intent` get `in`, `out` or `inout` inferred from the
  body, with a note above the procedure.
- A function whose name is its result variable gets an explicit result variable.
- Calls to procedures that exist nowhere in the file are marked TODO, because they would fail.
- Names that are Boreas keywords (`in`, `out`, `string`, ...) are renamed.

The converted file is checked by the test suite against real gfortran output.
Try it on `examples/number_toys.f90`.
